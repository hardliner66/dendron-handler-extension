# dendron-handler README

Helper extension to create links for [dendron-handler](https://github.com/hardliner66/dendron-handler).

Currently only creates links without a vault name, so you should use your shared vault as your default
vault or configure a certain vault as your default. To learn more about configuration, check the
dendron-handler repository.
