# dendron-handler README

Helper extension to create links for [dendron-handler](https://github.com/hardliner66/dendron-handler).

The extension currently doesn't download or install dendron-handler. To read up on how to install, go
to the dendron-handler repository.

Currently only creates links without a vault name, so you should use your shared vault as your default
vault or configure a certain vault as your default. To learn more about configuration, check the
dendron-handler repository.
